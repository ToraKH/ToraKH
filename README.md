Hello! I am Tora Kjetså Homme.
I'm a current informatics student at UiT Norges arktiske universitet. I enrolled in 2023 and will finish my master in cybersecurity in 2028.
I'm interested in coding, reading, gaming and horseback riding! I love doing small coding projects and games. The ones I am most proud of can be found in my public repositories. Feel free to take a look!
You can reach me on my LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/tora-kjetså-homme-975543350).
